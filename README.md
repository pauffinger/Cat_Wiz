## 📋 Overview

Cat_Wiz is a computational toolkit designed for structural biologists working with RNA-metal ion interactions. The software provides advanced stereochemistry-guided methods for identifying, analyzing, and annotating magnesium ions (Mg²⁺) in RNA crystal and cryo-EM structures.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Precise Localization**: Accurately identifies Mg²⁺ ion positions in RNA structures
- 🔍 **Diagnostic Tools**: Comprehensive analysis of metal coordination geometry
- 📝 **Automated Annotation**: Streamlined annotation workflow for structural data
- 🧪 **Stereochemistry-Guided**: Uses rigorous geometric and chemical validation
